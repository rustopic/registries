  The only aim in Rust is to survive. To do this you will need to overcome struggles
  such as hunger, thirst and cold. Build a fire. Build a shelter. Kill animals for meat.
  Protect yourself from other players, and kill them for meat. Create alliances with
  other players and form a town. Do whatever it takes to survive.
